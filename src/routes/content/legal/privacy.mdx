### Email

If you send an email to Monospaced, we’ll email you back. If we end
up working together, or think we may do in the future, we’ll keep
your email in our contacts so we can stay in touch. No newsletters
and no spam. That’s it!

### Website

This website does not store your personal data. At all. We don’t
have a database to store it in. No cookies and no analytics. For
compliance with web font licences, we call a third-party hit counter
on each page load. But that’s all!
